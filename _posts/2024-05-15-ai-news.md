*Recently several people have asked me how I follow AI news. Below are some great resources.*

## YouTube

I like watching videos during my lunch break workouts. I can highly recommend the following channels.

## LinkedIn

On LinkedIt I like especially the posts from [Philipp Schmid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-schmid-a6a2bb196/) and [Andrew Jardine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-iain-jardine/).

[Armand Ruiz](https://newsletter.nocode.ai/p/manage-stay-uptodate-ai) wrote about his preferences how to stay up to date with AI news with more good resources.
