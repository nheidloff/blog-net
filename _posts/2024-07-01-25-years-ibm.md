*Today is my 25th anniverary at IBM. Times flies when you're having fun.*

I have the pleasure to work with so many nice and smart people. Thank you to my colleagues, to my managers, to my mentors, clients and partners and everyone else I've worked with over the 25 years.

I like IBM because of the people, but also since IBM has allowed me to work in so many different roles, different organizations and different locations and to learn something new every day.

I also want to thank my family, especially my wife who is supporting me to make sure I can work in a job which I love. The picture above is from a recent trip where IBM invited us to.
