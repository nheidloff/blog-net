*What a great year 2023 has been!*

When ChatGPT was published at the end of 2022, I knew it would change the world. I wanted to learn and understand this technology. Fortunately, through my network of friends, managers and mentors I was able to work on Generative AI with some of our biggest clients and partners this year.

I've been in the IT industry for several years and have seen a lot. But I've never experienced such a fast pace of innovation. Capabilities that are possible and cheap today like fine-tuning of models didn't seem to be applicable for most companies at the beginning of this year. It also turned out that fine-tuned smaller and cheaper models can be as efficient as really large generic models.

## Highlights

As always it has been a pleasure to work with so many smart colleagues at IBM. While I had worked as developer and developer advocate earlier, this year I focused on AI and learned a lot from IBM's AI experts.

Topics:

* AI and Generative AI
* LLM - Large Language Model
* RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation
* Prompt Engineering
* Fine-Tuning and GPUs
* AI experiments
* Models: Granite, FLAN T5, LLaMA, Falcon, ...
* Semantic searches and vector searches

Key technologies: 

* Hugging Face
* Python
* PyTorch
* Open Source

Products:

* IBM Watsonx.ai
* IBM Watson Assistant
* Elastic Elasticsearch
